Closure Compiler Recursive
--------------

A thin wrapper around Google's closure-compiler that minimizes time and memory
when compiling the contents of a directory recursively.

Usage:

    bin/closure-compiler-recursive /path/to/closure-compiler.jar /directory/to/compress

Requirements:

This depends on the closure compiler JAR from google:
    CLASS_PATH=./closure-compiler-v20170910.jar
